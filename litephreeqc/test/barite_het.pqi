## Here a 5x2 domain:
##    |---+---+---+---+---|
## -> | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
##  4 |---+---+---+---+---|
## -> | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
##    |---+---+---+---+---|

## East boundary: "injection" of solution 4. North, W, S boundaries: closed

## Here the two distinct zones: nr 2 with kinetics Celestite (initial
## amount is 0, is then allowed to precipitate) and nr 3 with kinetic
## Celestite and Barite (both initially > 0) where the actual
## replacement takes place

## NB: again, the *result* of the SOLUTION 4 script defines the
## concentration of all elements (+charge, tot H, tot O)

## Ideally, in the initial state SOLUTION 1 we should not have to
## define the 4 elemental concentrations (S(6), Sr, Ba and Cl) but
## obtain them having run once the scripts with the aqueous solution
## resulting from SOLUTION 1 once with KINETICS 2 and once with
## KINETICS 3.
