Description: R interface to the PHREEQC program.  PHREEQC is a geochemical
    modeling program developed by the US Geological Survey that is designed to
    perform a wide variety of low-temperature aqueous geochemical calculations.
    PHREEQC is based on an ion-association aqueous model and has capabilities
    for (1) speciation and saturation-index calculations; (2) batch-reaction
    and one-dimensional (1D) transport calculations involving reversible
    reactions, which include aqueous, mineral, gas, solid-solution,
    surface-complexation, and ion-exchange equilibria, and irreversible
    reactions, which include specified mole transfers of reactants, kinetically
    controlled reactions, mixing of solutions, and temperature changes; and (3)
    inverse modeling, which finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers that
    account for differences in composition between waters, within specified
    compositional uncertainty limits.
